# SUTD Term 2 Revision Project
As part of our Computational Thinking and Design Class, we made a quiz like game that students can use to do revision for their final examinations using Jupyter Notebook. 

### SetUp
1. Download to file into your local python interpreter( example, VS code, Anaconda Jupyter notebook etc)
2. Start the game by following the instructions

### Future Development
We will make a webapp using Flask that students can run using their local server for better user experience (in the process of making)
